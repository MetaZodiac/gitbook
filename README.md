# ðŸŒŽ The Law of Metaworld

Currently, more and more technology companies are discussing and building metaverse. Many technicians see metaverse as a virtual world where a large number of people can gather to play, work and socialize. They believe that the metaverse is about to become a collection of digital worlds where all goods can be manufactured and priced, and they believe that this realism will provide users with a better metaverse experience.

And in this metaverse concept mania atmosphere, we believe that the real metaverse should not just be purely virtual space and commodities, but on the premise of respecting real scientific data and benchmarking the value of actual items, integrating different digital worlds corresponding to the real world, in order to make the metaverse more real. We believe that making virtual items correspond to real values is the only way to make these items truly part of the metaverse. We call this: the law of Metaworld. For this reason we started to organize and invite more domain experts with the same beliefs to work together to build and govern our metaworld idea in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and in order to be able to seal our Metaworld law to the world, after many discussions in the team, we decided to prioritize the launch of Meta-zodiac.
