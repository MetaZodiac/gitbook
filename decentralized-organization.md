# üè¢ Decentralized Organization

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Relying on the open technical nature of the blockchain, the meta-world stars will gradually evolve into a decentralized organization owned by the entire online community through Lucky's fair generation mechanism. This process will occur when Lucky is distributed among players and equity holders, and over time our community members will grow, meaning that ownership of the meta-world team becomes less centralized.

The founding team will be able to vote using locked Lucky reward allocations. Prevent some funding bodies from disrupting our ecosystem in the early and critical stages of development. We estimate that by October 2023, Meta-zodiac will be well on its way to becoming a truly decentralized organization.
