# ðŸš© Galactic Community Economy

In the early days of the Metaworld team publishing the Metaworld law concept, we have already received positive comments and attention from users all over the internet, which encouraged our staff and gave us more confidence to build this real Metaverse Constellation. The main difference between Meta-zodiac and traditional games is that the blockchain's economic model unlocks the ability of all the economies of ordinary players in traditional games. All players are able to participate in every process of the game fairly under the blockchain's open economic model, and Meta-zodiac can reward community contributors and advanced skill level players with more luck based on these fair data.

Now, our community members are spread all over the countries with different cultural groups, and in order to better enhance the perfection of Meta-zodiac, we have opened the following aspects of interaction and feedback with the community. And all player members within the community can have fun and work towards their goals while earning potential resources with real monetary value.

Currently, community players can get more resources to participate in advancing the game by taking the following actions

1. Share your horoscope data to allow the technical team to better refine the Meta-zodiac
2. Build your community, gather players around you to promote your community, the best ones will be supported and rewarded accordingly
3. Participate in the public test activities of Planet Meta-zodiac and win rewards.
