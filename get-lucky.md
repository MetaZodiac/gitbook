In the process of opening the box, you need to consume a certain amount of MW as energy. Each opening will produce constellations with random rarity and attributes. Each wallet address can open a maximum of 6 lucky boxes per day. And when you collect more NFTs with different attributes, you will find that the various magical powers of the constellations will bring you a very diverse range of luck. And these fortunes will bring you about love, career, health, wealth and many other aspects of improvement. Next, please open your lucky magic box.
