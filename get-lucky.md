# ðŸ’° Get Lucky

![](.gitbook/assets/çŽ©æ³•.png)

In Meta-zodiac, whether it's the Zodiac sign, the Northern sign, or the Southern sign, each sign can gain the corresponding luck value and have an unpredictable impact on the situation through powerful matching effects. You can use the NFT constellation to participate in various gameplay to enhance the luck value of the constellation and gain more lucky.

### Lucky Magic Box

Welcome to Meta-zodiac. This is an open Metaverse Constellation NFT game, relying on the decentralized mechanism setting, players of any background can open the lucky magic box fairly in the world of Meta-zodiac to get their own exclusive constellation NFT. In the process of opening the box, you need to consume a certain amount of MW as energy. Each opening will produce constellations with random rarity and attributes. Each wallet address can open a maximum of 6 lucky boxes per day. And when you collect more NFTs with different attributes, you will find that the various magical powers of the constellations will bring you a very diverse range of luck. And these fortunes will bring you about love, career, health, wealth and many other aspects of improvement. Next, please open your lucky magic box.

First of all, please prepare a wallet that supports Coin Smart Chain (BSC).

Then, you need a small amount of BNB for the gas fee and prepare a certain amount of MW.

Finally, consume a certain amount of MW to get your own NFT constellation and use the constellation to get more luck in the game.

### **Starlight prayer**

After all constellations are authorized by the user, they can perform starlight prayers in the prayer field and receive Lucky rewards. All Constellation can get 96 Lucky by praying every day. The amount of Lucky obtained each day may also be affected by unexpected events, such as the formation of black holes, supernova explosions, and the collapse of the universe.

&#x20;

Of course, different levels of constellations will also affect the effect of praying for Lucky. Level is one of the most important attributes of a constellation. Increasing the level of a constellation can not only increase the speed of collecting Lucky, but also reduce the impact of interstellar accidents. Therefore, increasing the constellation level is an effective way to get more Lucky. The higher the level, the more Lucky you get.

&#x20;

The constellations obtained by the lucky box are all level 1. If we need to upgrade the level, we need to consume a certain amount of MW and Lucky to upgrade the level of the constellation.

&#x20;Notice:

1\. Please note that there is a possibility of failure when upgrading a constellation. Failure to upgrade will cause the constellation to be downgraded.

### Constellation Matching

Players can spawn new constellations through constellation pairing. You only need to have two level 6 or above constellations to pair up by burning LUCKY and have a certain probability of successful pairing. After 3 days of successful pairing, players will have a chance to burn a certain amount of LUCKY to produce a new constellation at random. The success rate of the new constellation will be affected by the luck value of the matching constellation.

### Collecting Starlight

To collect Starlight, you need to have 3 different zodiac signs or 6 northern signs. The higher the constellation attribute, the higher the probability of success in starlight collection. Players can collect Starlight to obtain Luckily, Ancient Key and Treasure Cabinet Fragment, collecting 4 Star Treasure Cabinet Fragments will gain mysterious wealth. However, please note that collecting Starlight also has the possibility of failure.

### Multiplayer Blessing

Players can participate in the multiplayer blessing game by teaming up, the game requires a group of 12 people, each person must hold a zodiac sign of the same level, and not repeat. The multiplayer blessing game will get luckier compared to the starlight blessing.

### Astrological Divination

### Wishing Pool

All Lucky consumed by players during the game will be partially accumulated in the Wishing Pool. Collecting 6 different pieces of ancient constellations can synthesize epic constellations. Epic Constellations have great power and can help players complete higher-level quests; players can also choose to use it to open the Wishing Pool to receive half of the rewards in the Wishing Pool, which will fall when the Wishing Pool is opened.
