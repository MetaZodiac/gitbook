In the vastness of the universe, constellations divide the entire celestial sphere into two major parts: the northern and southern celestial spheres. Depending on whether the majority of each constellation is in the northern or southern , they are called the northern or southern constellations, respectively. In 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially accepted the modern list of 88 constellations and in 1928 adopted official constellation boundaries that collectively cover the entire celestial sphere. Any given point in the celestial coordinate system is located in one of the modern constellations. This is scientific.

For most of its history, astrology was considered a traditional academic discipline, common in academic circles and often closely associated with astronomy, alchemy, meteorology and medicine. It appears in political circles, but also in famous literary figures from Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer to William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega and Calderon de la Barca are often mentioned in published works. In Western astrology, the 12 signs of the zodiac are synonymous with cosmic directions, and the position of each star on the zodiac at the time of one's birth indicates one's innate personality and talents. The 12 signs of the zodiac symbolize the psychological dimension, reflecting the way a person behaves. It is sacred.

And as the only constellation ecology in the metaverse world, we have produced corresponding constellation NFTs based on the 88 scientific constellations that can be integrated into any future metaverse platform, which gives the Meta-zodiac' NFT assets an unpredictable value in the future.

In order to enhance the more expandable nature of the Meta-zodiac, we have made a subtle and exquisite creation in the rules of the game without changing the facts, beliefs and logicality of all aspects, based on the premise of following scientific facts, the principle of respecting the sanctity of astrology, and the fundamental respect for the cultural beliefs of all nationalities around the world, to create a fair, fun and highly playable set of innovative rules for the Meta-zodiac.
