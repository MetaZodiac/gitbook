# ðŸ‘¶ Constellation Classification (Characters)

Now, let's start to understand the classification rules of Meta-zodiac.

In the Meta-zodiac, there are a total of 89 constellations, which we classify into four categories: Southern , Northern , Ecliptic and Epic; among them, there are 48 Southern constellations, 24 Northern constellations, 12 Ecliptic constellations and 5 Epic constellations. The attributes and acquisition probability of different constellations are different.
