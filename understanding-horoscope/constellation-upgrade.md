# ðŸŒ  Constellation upgrade

The initial level of the constellation obtained through any means in the platform is 1. Players can consume a certain amount of MW and LUCKY to upgrade them, and the LUCKY collection efficiency of higher level constellations will be higher while the basic attributes of the constellation remain unchanged. Meanwhile, higher constellation levels can also unlock higher-order missions.
